# marginalntcp
 
We provide source code for the simulation studies and simulated illustration of the proposed methods for the journal article "A marginal model for normal tissue complication probability" by authors Thai-Son Tang, Zhihui Liu, Ali Hosni, John Kim, Olli Saarela.

We recommend running the R scripts using `marginalntcp_code.Rproj` in RStudio to keep the directories consistent. All source code was written using R version 4.1.2 on a macOS computer.

The repository consists of:
* Source code for the simulation studies (`simulation` folder)
* Source code for an illustration of the proposed methods on a simulated dataset (`simulated_illustration` folder)

The `simulation` folder consists of:
- Source code for the simulation study described in the manuscript's main text (`main simulation` folder)
- Source code for the supplementary simulation studies (`supplementary simulation` folder)
- Essential functions required to run all simulation studies (`functions` folder)
- A `data` folder to store estimates from the simulation replicates.
